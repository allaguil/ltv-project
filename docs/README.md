LTV Front End Jr. Interview Technical Test

# Implementation
1. HTML5 Tags used for the Markup Design.
2. CSS layout grid was implemented using Flexbox and media queries to make it fully responsive, I started with the Mobile-first design.
3. JS logic was done using only vanilla JS, all values coming from API are dynamically injected.
4. I decided to apply all dynamic changes to same existing index.html page to simulate a SPA, instead of having a secondary page.
5. Created new Repo on GitHub and pushed changes to GitHub Pages as the hosting. URL: https://allaguil.github.io/ltv-project/index.html 

# Challenges
1. Dealing with the styles of the different sections using flexbox takes lot of time due to the variations of the Grid for each breakpoint.
2. Got some bugs with the overflow-y of a div wrapper after publishing, took me a while to figure it out and how to correct it.
3. Attention to details provided in the Mockup.

# Comments
Just want to say Congratulations to LVT Team for applying this technical test to the Developers.
I found it very useful and fun, it clearly works as a quality filter for the Company to have a better understanding of the Developer's knowledge and skills.
